        <P> What is a teachable machine?
            Teachable Machine by Google Creative Lab - Experiments with ...
            Teachable Machine is a web tool that makes it fast and easy to create machine learning models for your projects, no coding required. Train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, & poses, then export your model for your sites, apps, and more.</P>
    <h1> "2.How do you use teachable machine models?" </H1>
                What architecture does teachable machine use?
Teachable Machine uses TensorFlow. js, a library for machine learning in Javascript, to train and run the models you make in your web browser. Look at the Teachable Machine library built on top of TensorFlow.</body><p></p> 
<h1> 3."How does a teaching machine work?</h1>
    <p>In general, they all work on the same method, which is to present a question, have the user indicate the answer, and then provide the user with the correct answer. Some machines may be extremely simple, such as test sheets or books so programmed that the student locates the answers to the questions later." </H1>
